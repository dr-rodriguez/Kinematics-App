# Kinematics App

A web application to explore the 6-D space (XYZ-UVW) for stellar objects.

This takes in stellar parameters (RA, Dec, distance, etc) and generates 
interactive [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) figures and tables of calculated XYZ-UVW. 
In the absence of distances or radial velocities, these can be specified as a range of values to use.   
The form can also resolve object names with Simbad to grab the basic stellar parameters.

A live version of this application can be found at the [BDNYC website](http://kinematics.bdnyc.org/)
